# Yqloss Client Harmony

> A Mod for A Dance of Fire and Ice.
>
> *Named after Yqloss Client Mixin.*

## ✨ Features

* Fix killer decorations failing the game in no fail mode (count as "Overload!" if enabled)

* Fix Set Input Event making levels unplayable

* Fix malformed JSON format in saved .adofai files

* Prevent unintentionally exiting playing

* Play sound on game end

* Effect Remover

  > The level is modified when it's read from file, so the game doesn't even
  > know what it looks like before modifications. Thus, you cannot save a
  > modified level, or the file would be overwritten by the version after
  > modifications (unless you intend to do that).
  >
  > This also makes loading full-effect maps as if you are loading no-effect.
  > As fast and as low memory consumption.

* Replay

  > Things that are not supported: any input devices other than keyboards,
  > DLC contents (partially supported), official levels
  >
  > Please use "Normal" hold tile behavior when recording and playing replays.
  >
  > I've tried my best to keep the judgements and accuracy consistent
  > with the original play.
  >
  > (7BG what the f are you doing in your code??????)

## ❓ Common Issues

* **I can't load the mod! "!!!"**

  This is 90% because you downloaded the source code repository instead of the release file.

* **My planets are stuck in the main menu!**

  Update your Unity Mod Manager.

* **How do I start recording a replay?**

  Enable YCH and enable Replay in YCH settings. YCH will automatically record every play for you
  until you die or win. The replay will end every time you die and a new one will be recorded when
  you revive. The replay file will be saved in the specified location in settings.

  Please use asynchronous input system.

  Note that only some versions of KeyboardChatterBlocker are compatible with the replay recorder.
  I only tested 0.0.7 and 0.0.10 and 0.0.10 worked well while 0.0.7 didn't.

  DLC is not well-supported currently. Feel free to report issues related to DLC!

* **How do I play a replay?**

  Enable YCH and enable Replay in YCH settings. Open the level in level editor, click the "Load Replay"
  button and select the replay file (.ychreplay.gz or .ychreplaygz). Then adjust your game settings to match the
  recorder's game settings (except Async Input). Click "Jump to Start" and start playing the level.

  Disable KeyboardChatterBlocker while playing replays.

* **How do I fix the planets de-syncing with the floors while playing replays?**

  Disable KeyboardChatterBlocker while playing replays.

## ⚙️ How To Build

Install Unity Mod Manager in your ADOFAI.

Create `GameFolder.txt` in the project folder and write the path to your game folder (used by the installation scripts).

The content would be like:

```text
D:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\A Dance of Fire and Ice
```

Copy your ADOFAI game folder (generally located in `Steam/steamapps/common`) to `ADOFAIGame`.

The project folder structure would be like:

```text
YqlossClientHarmony
|-- GameFolder.txt
|-- ADOFAIGame
|   |-- A Dance of Fire and Ice
|       |-- A Dance of Fire and Ice.exe
|       |-- A Dance of Fire and Ice_Data
|       |   |-- Managed
|       |   |   |-- UnityModManager
|       |   |   |   |-- ...
|       |   |   |-- ...
|       |   |-- ...
|       |-- ...
|-- ...
```

Build the project with **Release** build profile.

Run Scripts/pack.ps1 with PowerShell if you want to make a Mod zip file. The zip file would be generated at
`build/YCH.zip` in the project folder.

Run Scripts/install.ps1 with PowerShell if you want to install the Mod directly into your game.

Don't worry if errors are printed during script execution.
